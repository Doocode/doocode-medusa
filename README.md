# Doocode Medusa

Next version of the main website of Doocode.

## Why Medusa ?

This website will live without a database.
It will be a static website.
That's why it was named "Medusa".

## Developing

You can start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy this app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
